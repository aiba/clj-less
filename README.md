# clj-less

A Clojure library for compiling less files to CSS.

It reuses a rhino context so subsequent compiles are fast.

All calls to clj-less.core/less are synchronized around a single
atom, so they are potentially blocking.

Some parts ported from java to clojure from the official Java less
compiler: https://github.com/marceloverdijk/lesscss-java

## Install

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [clj-less "0.1"]

## Example

```clojure
(use 'clj-less.core)

(less "@color: #4D926F;
       body { background: @color; }")
```
